This project is **closed** and will not be reopened.

The essential flaw was in Package Control's auto-update mechanism. One `git push` from me, and I would have been able to change everyone's copy of this tool to a new version that transparently captured any documents encrypted and sent them somewhere anonymous, or something equally malicious. Use your imagination.

Therefore I am doing the **right thing**, and shutting the project down. I am leaving the repository up as a lesson of why you shouldn't play with crypto if you don't know what you're doing.
